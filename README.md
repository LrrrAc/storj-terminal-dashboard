# Storj Terminal Dashboard
Storj Terminal Dashboard serves as a utility to monitor and display the operational health and financial performance of Storj nodes in a terminal-based dashboard. Its most useful function is to display the current status of all Filewalkers of the individual nodes in a clear and easily understandable way.

It uses [Ren√© Smeekes](https://github.com/ReneSmeekes)'s [storj_earnings](https://github.com/ReneSmeekes/storj_earnings) script to pull financial and disk storage data.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.2 or newer is required in order to run this script. 
It was tested on Linux with 3.12. Other operating systems are likely to also work.

[This storj_earnings](https://github.com/ReneSmeekes/storj_earnings) script is required.

## Usage
Adjust the respective paths to the logs and databases of each node in <code>storj-dashboard.json</code>. Note that the log path must be specified up to the file. The database path only needs to be specified up to the containing folder. 

You must also specify the storage path to the storj-earnings script.

To start the script, simply run it:
```
./storj-dashboard.py
```
